In this workshop, we will study different solutions to get AWS security and log data into Splunk. We will look at different GDI solutions like:
1) Ingesting AWS data using Amazon Data Firehose <b>(PUSH method)</b>
2) Ingesting AWS data using AWS Lambda Function <b>(PUSH method)</b>
3) Ingesting AWS data from S3 bucket and APIs using Splunk Add-on for AWS <b>(PULL method)</b>
4) Ingesting AWS data from EventBridge using inbuilt HTTP POST <b>(PUSH method)</b>

Finally in <b>lab 5</b> you will wrap up by exploring some of your ingested data in Splunk using SPL and saving that data into a custom dashboard!
