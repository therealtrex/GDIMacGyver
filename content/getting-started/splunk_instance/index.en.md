To complete this workshop, you will need a Splunk instance to ingest data and setup the Splunk Add-on for AWS.

If you are doing this workshop as part of an AWS or Splunk sponsored event, a splunk instance will be created for you.

If you are doing this workshop on your AWS account then you would need to setup a Splunk instance.
